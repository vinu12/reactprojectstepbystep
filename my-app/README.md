Functional component in react 

Functional components are a way to define reusable UI elements in React.


Functional components are a fundamental concept in React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Functional components are a way to define reusable UI elements or pieces of the user interface in a declarative and composable manner.

In React, you can create components using either class components or functional components. Functional components were traditionally used for simpler, stateless components. However, with the introduction of React Hooks in React 16.8, functional components can also manage state and have side effects, making them suitable for complex components as well.
